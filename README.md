## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Resource discovery, e.g., FaaS, is achieved by function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models within the decentralized serverless paradigm.

## How to Participate

Register via [devpost](https://web3infinityhackathon.devpost.com/). Build a dapp using Fluence and Aqua.

## Hacking With Fluence

The Fluence peer-to-peer compute protocol, aka decentralized serverless, allows you to create decentralized off-chain protocols and applications with ease. To get you going, you may want to look at Fluence and Aqua to

* decentralize centralized components, bottlenecks and choke-points in your existing web3 DApp
* create decentralized peer-to-peer protocols to replace centralized off-chain solutions by means of decentralized off-chain oracles or by swapping centralized service providers, e.g., AWS Lambda, for a decentralized infrastructure
* decentralize centralized off-chain solutions such as relayers for single- or multi-chain bridges
* enable dynamic NFTs by creating one or more decentralized off-chain oracles to provide (continuous) data feeds to your NFTs

## Hacking On Fluence

For a quick overview, see our [Hacking On Fluence](https://fluencenetwork.notion.site/Hacking-On-Fluence-Primer-28a87754397048e1bec72e3bfc91fd9b) document as well as the [examples](https://github.com/fluencelabs/examples) repo.

A variety of [examples and tutorials](https://github.com/fluencelabs/examples) are available including [evm-integration]([TBD](https://github.com/fluencelabs/examples/tree/main/aqua-examples/evm-integration)).
